# Week 4 Homework

## Part 1

I pushed the in class examples we did to [this repo](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-module3-week4).
Clone it and play with it.

The only changes from what was in class are:
 - More comments
 - Added a side menu with routing

I want you guys to go through each area and make sure you **FULLY UNDERSTAND**:
- Client
	- Angular Routing
	- `HttpClient`
	- The various examples/sections
- Server
	- Express and Node
	- Express routes
- How client and server communicate


## Part 2

#### Git

We're going to start using git and Github much more. If you're not familiar with git, here are some resources:

- [What is Git?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-git-and-why-should-I-use-it)
- At least one of:
	- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
	- [Codecademy - Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
	- [Code School - Git Real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real)
- [Github - Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Be sure you understand git basics (adding files, committing, etc) and how to use git with Github.


## Part 3

#### Promises

We'll be using more Promises in the next module.  It's time to learn about them!

- [Simple Guide to ES6 Promises](https://codeburst.io/a-simple-guide-to-es6-promises-d71bacd2e13a?gi=7d2993194983)


## Part 4

#### MongoDB and Mongoose
MongoDB is a [NoSQL](http://www.monitis.com/blog/cc-in-review-the-key-differences-between-sql-and-nosql-dbs/) database server.

Mongoose is a library that allows us to connect to MongoDB using NodeJS.

#### Installing MongoDB
Please read and install MongoDB for your laptop: [MongoDB Tutorials](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/).

If you run into problems, please ask me about them **BEFORE** Saturday's class!

#### MongoDB Tutorials
Please read [An Introduction to MongoDB](https://scotch.io/tutorials/an-introduction-to-mongodb) for a good intro and overview of what MongoDB is.


#### Robo 3T

Robo 3T is a GUI (Graphic User Interface) for MongoDB.  MongoDB comes with a commandline tool, but it is far from user-friendly.  Robo3T makes using MongoDB painless.

**Note:** We'll be using Mongoose for your *code* to talk to MongoDB.  You (the human) will be using Robo3T to view/edit/delete your MongoDB collections and documents.

Download it [here](https://robomongo.org/download).  **Note:** Download Robo 3T, **not** Studio 3T.


#### Mongoose

Finally, read/skim over [Mongoose's Getting Started](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) guide.
