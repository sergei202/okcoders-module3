# Week 4 Homework

## Part 1

I pushed the in class examples we did to [this repo](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-module3-week4).
Clone it and play with it.

The only changes from what was in class are:
 - More comments
 - Added a side menu with routing

I want you guys to go through each area and make you **FULLY UNDERSTAND**:
- Client
	- Angular Routing
	- `HttpClient`
	- The various examples/sections
- Server
	- Express and Node
	- Express routes
- How client and server communicate
