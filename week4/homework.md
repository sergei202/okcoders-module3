# Week 4 Homework

## Part 1

I pushed the in class examples we did to [this repo](https://github.com/sergei202/okcoders-module3-week4).
Clone it and play with it.

The only changes from what was in class are:
 - More comments
 - Added a side menu with routing

I want you guys to go through each area and make sure you **FULLY UNDERSTAND**:
- Client
	- Angular Routing
	- `HttpClient`
	- The various examples/sections
- Server
	- Express and Node
	- Express routes
- How client and server communicate


## Part 2

#### Git

We're going to start using git and Github much more. If you're not familiar with git, here are some resources:

- [What is Git?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-git-and-why-should-I-use-it)
- At least one of:
	- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
	- [Codecademy - Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
	- [Code School - Git Real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real)
- [Github - Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Be sure you understand git basics (adding files, committing, etc) and how to use git with Github.
