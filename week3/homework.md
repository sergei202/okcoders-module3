# Week 3 - Homework

## Part 1

Clone the [angular-node-template](https://github.com/sergei202/angular-node-template) repo and set it up on your laptop.
Read the repo instructions on setting up and running.  

- If you need help cloning: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/
- If you need help installing Git: https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03
- Review the code, make sure you understand it.  Ask questions!

## Part 2

Add another area to the `ExamplesComponent` that will add two numbers _on the server_:

- You'll need two `<input>` fields
- You'll need a way for the user to trigger it (like a button)
- A function for the button to call
- The function needs to call a route on the server (I suggest `/api/example/add`)
- A route on the server to do the heavy-lifting of adding two numbers

You have everything you need to do that in this repo, all the pieces are there.
